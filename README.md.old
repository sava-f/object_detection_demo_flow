## Steps
1. Train the neural network
2. Verify the result
3. Convert the network to a blob format

### Environment setup

Log into opecv machine:
        - ssh opencv@10.81.1.118  psw: opencv

run the conda:
        - su_conda
activate the proper environment
        - conda activate ssd

### Training the neural network
launch the training notebook:
        - jupyter notebook train.ipynb
